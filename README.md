# Titanic Prediction

Titanic prediction refers to the task of building a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic ship. This problem is often used as a beginner-level project in data science and machine learning. By analyzing various features such as age, gender, class, and cabin location, models can be trained to predict the survival outcome, providing insights into the factors that influenced survival rates on the Titanic.
